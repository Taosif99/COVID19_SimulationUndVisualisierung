<style="InfoH">About Us</style>

We are a group of students from the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences who implemented a simple COVID-19 simulation as a part of a university project. Our goal is to offer an intuitive COVID-19 simulation which does not require deep scientific knowledge to use and to understand.


<style="InfoH">Objects & Counters</style>

In the simulation it is possible to place and remove households, workplaces and hospitals. Each type of venue has attributes which can be defined. It is possible to save the simulation configuration, which includes the attributes of the venues and epidemiological parameters.
Above each venue there is a counter, which indicates the amount of uninfected people (<color=green>green</color>), infected people(<color=orange>orange</color>) and infectious people(<color=red>red</color>).
The hospital counter also shows how many normal beds are occupied (<color=#6495ED>blue</color>) and how many intensive beds are occupied (<color=#b900b9>Magenta</color>).


<style="InfoH">Phases of Infection</style>

When a person becomes infected with COVID-19, the person goes through the following phases of infection [1][2][3].

Phase 1: The person is infected
Phase 2: The person is infected and infectious
Phase 3: The person is infected, infectious and has symptoms
Phase 4: The person is infected, has symptoms and is starting with the recovery process
Phase 5: The person recovered


<style="InfoH">Masks</style>

There are 3 types of masks in our simulation. Fabric masks with 75% protection against infections, medical masks with 90% protection and the FFP2 masks with 94% [7].
The masks are worn everywhere except in the household.


<style="InfoH">Hospitalization</style>

If there are enough regular and intensive beds in the simulation, then the following is ensured:
* Each person who needs a regular bed gets one
* Each person who needs an intensive care bed gets one
* If a person must be transferred from a regular bed to an intensive bed (or vice versa) the hospital of the person may change

If the number of beds is not enough, the following is ensured:
* Persons who must be in intensive care get/stay at least in a regular bed
* If a person does not get a bed at all, then it stays in phase 3 at home until the person dies or recovers

As default parameters average values from the <i>Robert Koch-Institut</i> in order to determine the time periods of the phases of infection [3].
The probability of the infection factor is 3.8% and the probability of reinfection factor is 0.02% [4][5].


<style="InfoH">Tests at Workplaces</style>

In the simulation there is a possibility to carry out corona tests for employees at the beginning of the shift. 
The frequency of the test depends on the workplace. In hospitals, every Thursday is tested and in other workplaces every Monday and Wednesday.
Statistics from the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut were used for the test probabilities [6].


<style="InfoH">Workplaces & Work shifts</style>

There are two types of configurable workplaces: store and other. 

Workers in a store work in the following shifts:
1.	Work shift: Monday-Saturday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
2.	Work shift: Monday-Saturday from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Workers in other workplaces work in the following shifts:
1.	Work shift: Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 

Since a hospital is also a workplace, workers have in this case the following shifts:
1.	Work shift: Monday-Sunday 0 a.m. to 8 a.m.
2.	Work shift: Monday-Sunday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
3.	Work shift: Monday-Sunday 4 p.m. to 0 a.m. 


<style="InfoH">Shopping</style>

The other type of activity the people in the simulation have is grocery shopping / shopping runs.
The number of times people go out to shop each week can be configured per household.
These shopping runs always last 1 hour and are scheduled automatically when the simulation begins, choosing a random person, a random day, and a random available time slot in their day. 
Selecting the store the person goes to is also done at random when the simulation begins.
